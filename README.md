# 1. Introduction 
The Furuta Pendulum consists of a driven arm rotating horizontally, and a pendulum attached to the arm that operates freely in the vertically. The mechanism is designed to be unconstrained pneumatically, and nonlinear due to centrifugal and gravitational forces on the coupler allowing a variety of different movements to occur. This project will examine creating a test platform in a control system, that will in turn, efficiently test this model fluidly, and at a low cost.
