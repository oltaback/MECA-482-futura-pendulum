# 1. Introduction 
The Furuta Pendulum consists of a driven arm rotating horizontally, and a pendulum attached to the arm that operates freely in the vertically. The mechanism is designed to be unconstrained pneumatically, and nonlinear due to centrifugal and gravitational forces on the coupler allowing a variety of different movements to occur. This project will examine creating a test platform in a control system, that will in turn, efficiently test this model fluidly, and at a low cost. The delieravle sand desgin requirements for this project are stated below.

# 2. Control System Design 
Primarily, operational and logical viewpoints are created to theoritcally deteremine the placement of all components before physically building the model. These view points are widely used across control system archecture design. The operational view point essentially shows what happens, and were within the system this process occurs. The figure below describes the operational viewpoint for this control system archetecture. In this viewpoint, two sensors are placed on the each arm. One of the horizontally rotating arm, and one on the vertically rotating arm. The data taken from these axises of rotation is essential to the mathematical model.
